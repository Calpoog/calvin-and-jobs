          <p>
            I enjoy blurring the lines between technology and design. Deep
            knowledge of both disciplines leads to up-front reduction in time
            spent by navigating and parallelizing circular dependencies in
            requirements gathering and strategy. Tactical communication and
            translation skill eliminates often-hazardous channels between the
            design and development process. Pair that with expertise which
            drills into low level design and development implementation and
            there are more efficiencies to be gained.

            Understanding the problem, creative solutions, design, UX,
            architecture, development, upskilling, micro interactions,
            analytics, and moreâ€”I like to solve challenges.

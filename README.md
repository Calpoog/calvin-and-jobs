This resume site was created with Figma for up-front designs and built with React.

## About me

I enjoy blurring the line between technology and design. My deep knowledge of both disciplines leads to up-front reduction in requirements gathering and strategy. In addition, it provides a smoother communication channel and a breakdown of any “language barrier” between designer and developer. Pair that with expertise which drills into low level design and development implementation and there are more efficiencies to be gained. I am an evangelist for best practices in both design and development, as well as an advocate for the design process to developers and the development process to designers.

Understanding the problem, creative solutions, design and design systems, UX, architecture, development, upskilling, micro interactions, analytics, and more—I like to solve challenges.
